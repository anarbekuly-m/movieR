🎬 MovieR — Online Movie Platform

Django REST Framework + React + PostgreSQL

MovieR is a learning-focused but production-oriented project where I built a full-featured movie platform backend using Django and Django REST Framework, integrated with a React frontend.
The goal was to understand real backend architecture, API design, authentication, permissions, media handling, and performance optimization.

🚀 Features

User registration & session-based authentication

CRUD for Movies and Categories

Uploading & serving movie posters

Permissions & access control

Nested serializers & dynamic fields

Full serializer validation

Optimized SQL queries (select_related, prefetch_related)

Class-Based Views (ListAPIView, RetrieveAPIView, CreateAPIView, etc.)

PostgreSQL as the main database

Media storage inside project (movies/media)
